# About Me

Hi! I’m **Vishnu Iyengar**, a Computer Science student at the University of Washington (expected graduation: December 2025). I’m deeply interested in the intersection of **machine learning**, **systems**, and **software engineering** — particularly how we can build intelligent and efficient tools that help people in everyday life.

In addition to my coursework, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to academic research and intern in industry. Currently, I’m an undergraduate researcher at the **UW Reality Lab**, working on VR-based tools for audio localization. Previously, I interned at **Amazon Search ML Data Platform**, where I helped build infrastructure for real-time keyword analytics.

I also enjoy building tools from scratch — whether it’s browser extensions to understand your web habits or educational websites for learning Latin syntax!

When I’m not coding, I love playing squash, reading about cognitive science, and teaching others about technology.
